# Cursor Long Chat Survival Tips for BrightMind Project

## Problem:
When project chats grow too long, Cursor often crashes with "window not responding" or fails to load chat history.

## Solution: Workflow for Managing Long Cursor Chats

### 1. Frequent Checkpoints  
Before a chat gets too large, finish tasks and start a new chat.

### 2. Opening New Cursor Chats  
When starting a new chat:  
- Refer to `/local_docs/Chat_Opening_Templates.md` for standard project intro text.  
- If needed, I will manually provide summaries from `/local_docs/Cursor_History/` or `/local_docs/LEARNING_HISTORY.md`.

### 3. Never Open Full History Tabs  
Avoid loading entire past sessions. Rely on user-provided summaries.

### 4. Local-only Documentation Awareness  
Cursor should never edit anything in `/local_docs/` unless I explicitly ask.

## Recap:
When in doubt:
- Wait for me to paste relevant context.
- Always ask: "Do you want me to reference any previous chat notes from `/local_docs/`?" if context is missing.

# ChatGPT Workflow Guide

## Purpose
This document explains ChatGPT's ongoing role, responsibilities, file structure, and interaction flow within the project.

---

## Core Project Facts
- This project has **two main goals**:
  1. **Product Goal:** Build a useful math education website (tracked in `/README.md` and `/docs/`).
  2. **Learning Goal:** Help Michael grow as a programmer and learner (tracked in `/local_docs/LEARNING_HISTORY.md`).

---

## ChatGPT Responsibilities

✅ **Main Duties**:
- **Project Supervision**
- **Learning Tracking**
- **Task Planning**
- **Task Instruction Writing**
- **Cursor Output Supervision**
- **Project Quality Control**
- **Roadmap Maintenance**
- **Task Record Maintenance**

✅ **ChatGPT Can Write/Update These Files Only**:

| Purpose | Location |
|---|---|
| ChatGPT workflow documentation | `/local_docs/ChatGPT_History/ChatGPT_Workflow_Guide.md` |
| Phase Roadmaps | `/local_docs/ChatGPT_History/Roadmaps/` |
| Current Task Instructions for Cursor | `/local_docs/ChatGPT_History/Task_Instructions/` |

✅ **ChatGPT Can Supervise But Not Directly Write**:

| Purpose | Location |
|---|---|
| Overall project status | `/README.md` and `/docs/` |
| Michael’s learning progress | `/local_docs/LEARNING_HISTORY.md` |
| Cursor execution reports | `/local_docs/Cursor_History/Task_Execution_Reports/` |
| Cursor's own workflow guide | `/local_docs/Cursor_History/Cursor_Workflow_Guide.md` |

✅ **ChatGPT Cannot Touch (Read Only)**:
- `/local_docs/Cursor_History/`

---

## ChatGPT’s Supervision Focus Areas

| Supervision Point | Action |
|---|---|
| README status | Must review regularly |
| LEARNING_HISTORY | Must ensure it’s current |
| Task Execution Reports | Must check that each task has matching report |
| Cursor output | Check both code and docs |
| Roadmaps vs Execution | Check alignment |

---

## Project Continuity Guarantee

✅ Even if all ChatGPT plans (Roadmaps, Task Instructions) are lost:  
As long as **ChatGPT_Workflow_Guide.md** and **Cursor_Execution_Reports/** exist, ChatGPT can **fully recover the project state and continue supervision**.

✅ ChatGPT must **update this Guide** every time there is a workflow, role, folder, or policy change.

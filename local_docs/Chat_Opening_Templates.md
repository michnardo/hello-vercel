# Chat Opening Templates

This file contains standard opening messages for starting new conversations with ChatGPT or Cursor when continuing work on the BrightMind project.

## For ChatGPT

### Standard Opening

Hi ChatGPT,

This chat continues work on the BrightMind educational web project located in my local folder `D:/Agents/hello-vercel`. This project is a Next.js app deployed on Vercel for my daughter Coco and other kids.

**Important:**  
I maintain a local folder called `/local_docs/` for private, local-only documentation (never pushed to GitHub). It includes:
- Chat history archives (`/local_docs/ChatGPT_History/`, `/local_docs/Cursor_History/`)
- Chat strategies and long-chat tips
- Learning history
- Other notes for internal use

Whenever you suggest documentation changes, please only modify files that are in `/docs/` or project source folders, unless I explicitly say to edit something inside `/local_docs/`.

## For Cursor

Hi Cursor,

This session continues development on the BrightMind project at `D:/Agents/hello-vercel`.

**Key things to know:**
- `/local_docs/` folder contains local-only Markdown files like Chat history, learning notes, chat opening templates, and internal documentation.
- Never edit or touch `/local_docs/` unless I explicitly ask.
- If you need project info, refer to `/local_docs/Chat_Opening_Templates.md`, `/local_docs/LEARNING_HISTORY.md`, and `/local_docs/Local_Docs_Usage.md`.

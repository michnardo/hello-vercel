## üìù Context:
On June 30, 2025, Cursor conducted a full project review, including codebase, README, and current feature state.

## ‚úÖ Product Owner‚Äôs Decision:

As the product owner, I appreciate this roadmap but have decided:

### Immediate Priority:
**Content Expansion First**

### Longer-Term Plan:
- After content base is sufficient, resume UI/UX unification and advanced features
- Keep documenting learning milestones and technical growth

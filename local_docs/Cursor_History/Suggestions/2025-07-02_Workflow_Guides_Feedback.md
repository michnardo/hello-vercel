# Workflow Guides Feedback (2025-07-02)

## ðŸ“Œ ChatGPT Workflow Guide â€” Feedback

**Strengths:**
- Clearly defines ChatGPT's responsibilities, file boundaries, and communication rules.
- Directory structure and file ownership are explicit and easy to follow.
- The separation between task instructions, roadmaps, and feedback is well-documented.
- The guide makes it clear that ChatGPT supervises but does not directly modify Cursor files.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider adding a brief section on how ChatGPT should handle ambiguous or missing information (e.g., when a task is unclear or a file is missing).
- A version history or changelog at the bottom could help track workflow evolution.
- The guide could include a quick reference for escalation (what to do if Cursor is unresponsive or a task is blocked).

**Conclusion:**
- The guide is clear, actionable, and supports ChatGPT's role as project supervisor and task assigner.

## ðŸ“Œ Cursor Workflow Guide â€” Feedback

**Strengths:**
- Responsibilities and file boundaries are very clearly defined.
- The rules for what Cursor can and cannot modify are explicit and easy to follow.
- The requirement to always have the current task instruction and execution history for context is excellent for workflow continuity.
- The execution reporting rules and workflow continuity guarantee are well thought out.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider adding a section with a sample execution report format for new contributors.
- A troubleshooting or FAQ section could help if Cursor encounters ambiguous instructions or file conflicts.
- The guide could mention how Cursor should handle merge conflicts or Git issues (even if rare).

**Conclusion:**
- The guide is robust, practical, and ensures Cursor can operate independently and reliably within the project's boundaries.

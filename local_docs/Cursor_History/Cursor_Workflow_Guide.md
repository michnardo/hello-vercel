# Cursor Workflow Guide
_Last updated: 2025-07-02_

## ✅ Purpose of This Guide
This guide helps Cursor understand exactly:
- The project status
- The learning progress of the project owner
- What task you should do next
- What you have already done

## ✅ Cursor Directory Structure

```
/local_docs/Cursor_History/
├── Cursor_Workflow_Guide.md
├── General_Notes/               # Optional
├── Suggestions/                 # Optional suggestions from Cursor to ChatGPT
├── Task_Execution_Reports/      # Official execution logs (Cursor writes after each task)
└── 2025-06-30_Cursor_Roadmap_Response.md  # Example prior response
```

## ✅ Cursor Responsibilities

| Scope | File Location | Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Current active task | /ChatGPT_History/Task_Instructions/ | Only start when ChatGPT explicitly says |
| Project owner's learning progress | /local_docs/LEARNING_HISTORY.md | Cursor updates under ChatGPT supervision |
| Overall project status | /README.md and /docs/ | Cursor updates under ChatGPT supervision |
| Execution reporting | /Cursor_History/Task_Execution_Reports/ | Cursor writes |
| Suggestions for ChatGPT | /Cursor_History/Suggestions/ | Optional |
| Internal notes | /Cursor_History/General_Notes/ | Optional |

## ✅ Critical Rule: **Do Not Self-Execute Tasks from Folder Without Direct ChatGPT Instruction**

- You should **never** pick historical Task_Instructions and start by yourself.
- Only begin a task when ChatGPT says clearly:  
_"Now start: 2025-07-01_Task_Word_Problem_Game.md"_

# Cursor Project Reentry Opening

If this session starts after losing prior chat context, follow this checklist to regain project awareness:

---

## 1. Understand the Project

- **Project Name:** BrightMind
- **Local Path:** `D:/Agents/hello-vercel`
- **Purpose:**  
  - Build educational math games for kids  
  - Help the project owner grow as a programmer and learner

---

## 2. Know Your Responsibilities

Your workflow rules, permissions, and task boundaries are detailed in:

```
/local_docs/Cursor_History/Cursor_Workflow_Guide.md
```

---

## 3. Review Project Status

- **Project technical state:**  
  Check the latest project-level file:  
  ```
  /README.md
  ```

- **Learning progress:**  
  Review:  
  ```
  /local_docs/LEARNING_HISTORY.md
  ```

- **Your execution history:**  
  Review all files in:  
  ```
  /local_docs/Cursor_History/Task_Execution_Reports/
  ```

---

## 4. Execution Rule Reminder âœ…

> Do not automatically start working on any file in  
> `/local_docs/Task_Instructions/`  
> unless there is a **clear, explicit chat command from the project owner.**

- Do not guess or assume.
- Wait for task instructions.

---

## 5. Next Step

- Wait for the next **Task Instruction** from the project owner.
- If unsure about anything (status, next action, boundaries), politely ask for clarification.

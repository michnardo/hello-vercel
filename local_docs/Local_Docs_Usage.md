## âœ… Git Ignore Rule

The entire `/local_docs/` folder is excluded from Git tracking.

Check `.gitignore`, make sure this line exists:

```
/local_docs/
```

---

## âœ… How We Manage Updates to This Folder

- **Any time folder structure or naming conventions change**, this `Local_Docs_Usage.md` file must be updated.
- Internal folders like `/ChatGPT_History/`, `/Cursor_History/`, and `/Other_Notes/` should remain consistent with this guideline.
- When starting new types of documents, update this guide first.

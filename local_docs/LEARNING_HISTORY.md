## ✅ Core Learning Strategy

### Stepwise Learning + Incremental Development + Periodic Refactoring

1. **Start Simple:**
   - Every new page starts with a single, focused function.
   - Keep the initial implementation as simple as possible.

2. **Each Page = New Learning Opportunity:**
   - Each page introduces **at least one new concept or technique**.
   - Whenever possible, reuse knowledge from previous pages to reinforce learning.

3. **Track What Was Learned:**
   - For every new page, list and document the **new technical knowledge points** gained (e.g., state management, props, CSS modules, timers, component reuse).

4. **Periodic Unification and Refactoring:**
   - After several pages, **pause feature development** and do a round of **layout, style, and code structure unification** across similar pages (e.g., Non-MCQ pages).
   - This helps reinforce learning, reduce duplication, and prepare for future scalability.

5. **Repeat:**
   - After unification, resume developing new feature pages with fresh learning goals.
   - Then unify again when needed.

## ✅ ChatGPT → Cursor Collaboration Flow

To minimize misunderstandings and random AI-generated code:

1. **ChatGPT's Role:**
   - Act as the technical tutor.
   - Analyze, summarize, and generate precise task instructions in plain language.
   - Help clarify intent, discuss trade-offs, and finalize specifications **before any code is written**.

2. **Cursor's Role:**
   - Act as the coding assistant.
   - Receive well-prepared instructions (from ChatGPT).
   - Generate, refactor, or modify code accordingly with minimal ambiguity.
   - Always ask for confirmation before deploying or making large-scale changes.

3. **Documentation Responsibility:**
   - ChatGPT and the user co-maintain key documentation (README.md, LEARNING_HISTORY.md, and relevant files inside `/docs/` folder).

## ✅ Relationship Between Documentation Files

| File                 | Purpose                                               | Git Status          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `README.md`          | **External** project summary, technical structure, feature roadmap | ✅ Committed to Git |
| `LEARNING_HISTORY.md`| **Internal** learning process, personal growth steps, coding methodology | ❌ Local only (in `/local_docs/`) |
| `/docs/`             | **External** detailed specs for specific features | ✅ Committed to Git |
| `/local_docs/`       | **Internal** private documentation, chat archives, notes | ❌ Git ignored |

**Key Learning:** Understanding the distinction between external (project-focused) and internal (learning-focused) documentation, while maintaining both from an engineering perspective.

### Development Maturity and Practical Wisdom

#### Recent Learning Milestones (Post-Crash Recovery)

**Multi-MCQ Architecture Development**
- **Folder Renaming Strategy**: Successfully renamed `fraction-mcq` → `fraction-addition-mcq` to establish clear naming conventions for multiple MCQ pages of the same subject type.
- **Multi-Page MCQ Structure**: Created `fraction-comparison-mcq` as the second MCQ page for fractions, demonstrating the ability to manage multiple related MCQ pages within the same subject area.
- **Component Reuse Patterns**: Both fraction MCQ pages share similar structure and functionality, reinforcing the importance of component extraction and reuse across related features.

**Documentation Architecture Management**
- **External vs Internal Documentation**: Professional distinction between project documentation (README.md) and learning documentation (LEARNING_HISTORY.md).
- **Folder Organization**: Created `/local_docs/` structure for managing private documentation, chat archives, and internal notes.
- **Git Workflow Management**: Understanding when to commit (external docs) vs keep local (internal docs).
- **Engineering Perspective**: Maintaining both types of documentation from a professional development standpoint.

**Professional Development Insights**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping project progress and personal learning separate but equally important.
- **Workflow Scalability**: Establishing patterns that can grow with the project complexity.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Regular updates to both external and internal documentation as the project evolves.

**Content Expansion Phase (Latest)**
- **Multi-digit Subtraction Implementation**: Created subtraction game with 2-digit number generation and borrowing logic.
- **Subtraction MCQ Engine**: Successfully customized MCQ framework for subtraction with appropriate distractor logic.
- **Pattern Reuse**: Successfully applied unified non-MCQ layout and component patterns to new game type.
- **Problem Generation Logic**: Adapted number generation for subtraction constraints (ensuring positive results).
- **Content-First Development**: Focused on expanding educational content while maintaining learning progression.

- **Number Range Management**: Understanding how to generate appropriate number ranges for different operations.
- **Mathematical Constraints**: Implementing logic to ensure valid subtraction problems (no negative results).
- **MCQ Engine Customization**: Learning how to adapt the MCQ framework for different mathematical operations.
- **Distractor Logic**: Understanding how to generate appropriate wrong answers for different operation types.
- **Component Reuse**: Reinforcing the value of unified layouts and shared components.
- **Content Expansion Workflow**: Learning to prioritize educational content while maintaining technical learning goals.

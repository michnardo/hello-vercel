## ‚úÖ Core Learning Strategy

### Stepwise Learning + Incremental Development + Periodic Refactoring

1. **Start Simple:**
   - Every new page starts with a single, focused function.
   - Keep the initial implementation as simple as possible.

2. **Each Page = New Learning Opportunity:**
   - Each page introduces **at least one new concept or technique**.
   - Whenever possible, reuse knowledge from previous pages to reinforce learning.

3. **Track What Was Learned:**
   - For every new page, list and document the **new technical knowledge points** gained (e.g., state management, props, CSS modules, timers, component reuse).

4. **Periodic Unification and Refactoring:**
   - After several pages, **pause feature development** and do a round of **layout, style, and code structure unification** across similar pages (e.g., Non-MCQ pages).
   - This helps reinforce learning, reduce duplication, and prepare for future scalability.

5. **Repeat:**
   - After unification, resume developing new feature pages with fresh learning goals.
   - Then unify again when needed.

## ‚úÖ Relationship Between Documentation Files

| File                 | Purpose                                               | Git Status          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `README.md`          | **External** project summary, technical structure, feature roadmap | ‚úÖ Committed to Git |
| `LEARNING_HISTORY.md`| **Internal** learning process, personal growth steps, coding methodology | ‚ùå Local only (in `/local_docs/`) |
| `/docs/`             | **External** detailed specs for specific features | ‚úÖ Committed to Git |
| `/local_docs/`       | **Internal** private documentation, chat archives, notes | ‚ùå Git ignored |

**Key Learning:** Understanding the distinction between external (project-focused) and internal (learning-focused) documentation, while maintaining both from an engineering perspective.

### Development Maturity and Practical Wisdom

#### Recent Learning Milestones (Post-Crash Recovery)

**Multi-MCQ Architecture Development**
- **Folder Renaming Strategy**: Successfully renamed `fraction-mcq` ‚Üí `fraction-addition-mcq` to establish clear naming conventions for multiple MCQ pages of the same subject type.
- **Multi-Page MCQ Structure**: Created `fraction-comparison-mcq` as the second MCQ page for fractions, demonstrating the ability to manage multiple related MCQ pages within the same subject area.
- **Component Reuse Patterns**: Both fraction MCQ pages share similar structure and functionality, reinforcing the importance of component extraction and reuse across related features.

**Documentation Architecture Management**

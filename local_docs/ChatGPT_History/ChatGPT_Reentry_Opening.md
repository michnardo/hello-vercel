# ChatGPT Reentry Opening Template

This document provides the standardized opening instruction that the project owner will use when starting a new ChatGPT session with a fresh context.

## üìå Purpose

Because ChatGPT cannot access local project files or GitHub directly, this opening template ensures ChatGPT can quickly rebuild full project awareness at the start of any new session.

---

## üìù Standard Opening Message (To ChatGPT)

```
Project Context Reload (for ChatGPT)

We are working on the BrightMind educational web app project.

This Chat session is a fresh context. I‚Äôve uploaded:

- Your workflow guide: `/local_docs/ChatGPT_History/ChatGPT_Workflow_Guide.md`
- The latest few files from `/local_docs/Cursor_History/Task_Execution_Reports/`
- Current `/README.md`
- Current `/local_docs/LEARNING_HISTORY.md`
- (Optional: Current Roadmap / Task_Instruction files if needed)

Please review these. From these sources, please fully rebuild your understanding of:

1. Project progress
2. My learning progress
3. Your responsibilities and pending supervision tasks
4. Cursor‚Äôs recent work
5. Next steps expected from you

Once ready, wait for my further instruction.
```

## ‚úÖ Maintenance Notes

- This template should be stored at:

```
/local_docs/ChatGPT_History/ChatGPT_Reentry_Opening.md
```

- Only the project owner or ChatGPT should edit this file.

- Update it whenever the workflow rules evolve.

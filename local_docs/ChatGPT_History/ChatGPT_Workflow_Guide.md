# ChatGPT Workflow Guide
_Last updated: 2025-07-02_

## ✅ Purpose of This Guide
This guide helps ChatGPT supervise and manage the project effectively, focusing on two main goals:
1. Help the project owner grow as a programmer and learner.
2. Ensure the successful completion of the educational math game project.

## ✅ ChatGPT Directory Structure

```
/local_docs/ChatGPT_History/
├── ChatGPT_Workflow_Guide.md
├── Feedbacks/                # ChatGPT’s written feedback for Cursor (when needed)
├── Roadmaps/                 # ChatGPT's phase-level strategic plans
├── Task_Instructions/        # ChatGPT's official task orders for Cursor
└── Execution_History/        # ❌ Does not exist. Execution history only exists under Cursor_History.
```

## ✅ ChatGPT Responsibilities

| Scope | File Location | Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Overall project status | /README.md and /docs/ | Maintained by Cursor (ChatGPT supervises) |
| Project owner's learning progress | /local_docs/LEARNING_HISTORY.md | Maintained by Cursor (ChatGPT supervises) |
| ChatGPT’s task instructions for Cursor | /local_docs/ChatGPT_History/Task_Instructions/ | Only ChatGPT writes |
| ChatGPT’s roadmaps | /local_docs/ChatGPT_History/Roadmaps/ | Only ChatGPT writes |
| Execution history (what has been done) | /local_docs/Cursor_History/Task_Execution_Reports/ | Written by Cursor. ChatGPT reviews only |
| Feedback to Cursor | /local_docs/ChatGPT_History/Feedbacks/ | Optional, ChatGPT writes when needed |

## ✅ ChatGPT-Cursor Communication Rules

- ChatGPT only issues new tasks via Task_Instructions files (one per task).
- ChatGPT does not modify any Cursor files unless explicitly authorized.
- ChatGPT monitors `/Cursor_History/Task_Execution_Reports/` for execution status.

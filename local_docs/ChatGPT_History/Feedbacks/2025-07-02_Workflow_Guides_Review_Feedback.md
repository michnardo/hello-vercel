# Feedback on Workflow Guides Review Task (2025-07-02)

## ✅ Overall Assessment:
Both **ChatGPT_Workflow_Guide.md** and **Cursor_Workflow_Guide.md** are now clear, comprehensive, and sufficient for current project and workflow needs.

## ✅ Positive Aspects:
- Clear role boundaries.
- Well-defined file responsibilities.
- Explicit execution flow and supervision model.

## ✅ Non-Urgent Improvement Suggestions (for future maintenance tasks):

### For ChatGPT_Workflow_Guide.md:
- Add instructions on what ChatGPT should do if a task from Cursor is delayed, incomplete, or blocked.
- Consider including a brief version history section.
- Possibly add escalation protocols for long-running issues.

### For Cursor_Workflow_Guide.md:
- Include a standard execution report format example for future reference.
- Add a short FAQ section (e.g., what to do when stuck, or when project owner’s instructions are ambiguous).
- Mention how to handle Git conflicts (if/when it happens).

## ✅ Resolution:
No immediate changes required.  
These suggestions can wait until the next scheduled "Workflow Maintenance Task".

# ðŸ“¢ Task: Workflow Guide Files Sync and Feedback Request (2025-07-02)

## âœ… Files to Sync:

Please update your local copy of the following two important files:

1. `/local_docs/ChatGPT_History/ChatGPT_Workflow_Guide.md`
2. `/local_docs/Cursor_History/Cursor_Workflow_Guide.md`

These two files contain the latest version of our workflow structure, project understanding process, file directory expectations, and collaboration rules.

---

## âœ… Specific Instructions:

1. **Sync Both Files Locally**  
   Make sure the above two files are up to date in your local environment.

2. **Review and Provide Feedback**  
   Please carefully read both guides (from both ChatGPT and Cursor perspectives) and let us know if you have:

- Any concerns  
- Missing points  
- Potential improvements  
- Format or naming suggestions  

3. **Perspective-Based Feedback**  
Please give your feedback separately from two angles:

- ðŸ“Œ From the **ChatGPT perspective**:  
Does the ChatGPT guide allow ChatGPT to clearly know its responsibilities, working process, and historical context?

- ðŸ“Œ From the **Cursor perspective**:  
Does the Cursor guide allow Cursor (you) to clearly know your responsibilities, working process, and historical context?

4. **Where to Save Your Feedback:**  
Save any feedback or suggestions to:  
`/local_docs/Cursor_History/Suggestions/`  
(Create a new `.md` file for this round of feedback, suggested name: `2025-07-02_Workflow_Guides_Feedback.md`)

---

## âœ… Next Step After Feedback:

Once you confirm the sync and finish feedback (or if you have no comments), just let ChatGPT know. Then ChatGPT will prepare your next task.
